You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness.

      I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?

      Bane was a member of the League of Shadows. And then he was excommunicated. And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul, is not to be trifled with.

      The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act.

      Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?

      You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can't take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever's gonna know who saved the entire city.

      You want order in Gotham. Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.

      Didn't you get the memo?

      No gun? I'm insulted.

      It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

      Batman may have made the front page but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.

      I speak for the rest of the board and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.

      There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itseIf!

      Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place."

      Fish don't fry in the kitchen and beans don't burn on the grill. Took a whole lotta tryin' just to get up that hill. Thank you for being a friend. Travelled down the road and back again.

Michael Knight a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent. The helpless. The powerless in a world of criminals who operate above the law. Doin' it our way.

      Here's the story of a lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely girls., 'Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum. What might be right for you may not be right for some.' It's time to play the music. It's time to light the lights. It's time to meet the Muppets on the Muppet Show tonight. And when the odds are against him and their dangers work to do. You bet your life Speed Racer he will see it through?

      Well we're movin' on up to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. Today still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune. A man is born he's a man of means. Then along come two they got nothin' but their jeans. No phone no lights no motor car not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe it's primitive as can be.
